# pgs-recolor

## Usage

1. Get Python 3
2. Get the subtitle files
3. Run `python pgs-recolor.py /path/to/files/*.sup` -> outputs files with `_bw` suffix in the same directory
4. Use the `*_bw.sup` subtitle files

## What is this?

Quick, dirty and dumb simple script changing ugly yellow PGS subtitles to more tolerable grayscale. 

Inspired by:
- [pgsreader](https://github.com/EzraBC/pgsreader) (seriously, understanding the format and prototyping would have been much more challenging without it),
- lack of tooling allowing modification of PGS subtitles (or at least I did not found anything promising)
- media players that cannot change colors of PGS subtitles in-flight.


## Theory

PGS format (usually with '.sup' extension) is a binary format containing equally binary images of subtitles.
Any significant modification (like fonts or shadows) requires migration to a normal text-based subtitle format via OCR
and playing with styles. For my purposes however, only changing the ugly piss-yellow color would suffice.

Luckily, PGS stores color information as palettes. 
If text images reference "piss-yellow", we can just redefine what "piss-yellow" is.
Leveraging the palette format (YCrCb) makes things even simpler - 
we can just drop all color information whatsoever and leave only the glorious grayscale by setting Cr and Cb to 128 and
leaving luma Y intact. 
If the luma happens to be too gray - moving it away from 128 towards black or white would also be relatively simple.

The obvious downside is of course throwing away any color-coding of dialogs or signs. But I can live with that.
